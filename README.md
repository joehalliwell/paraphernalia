# Paraphernalia

An assortment of tools for making digital art from Joe Halliwell
(@joehalliwell).

This is an incubator for immature scripts/modules with an asbolute holy hell of
dependencies. Mature scripts/modules will be packaged more carefully and live
elsewhere. If I get around to it.

## Quick start guide

For developers: `poetry install`

## TODOs

### render

- Support all/more Book of Shaders uniforms
- Support all Shadertoy uniforms (see https://github.com/iY0Yi/ShaderBoy)
- Support buffers

## jupyter

- Detect if running in Colaboratory and adjust accordingly

## torch

- Device independence
- overtile() should support configurable overlap
